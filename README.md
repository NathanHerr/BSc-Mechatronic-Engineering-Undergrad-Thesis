# BSc-Mechatronic-Engineering-Undergrad-Thesis

This repository contains all the relevant data, code and figures for my undergrad thesis.

Take note of the following:

 - Raw sEMG data contains each separate reading taken on day 1. Each reading contains 5 channels, where each channel contains a sequence of repetions of a single hand gesture.

- Raw sEMG data 2 contains each separate reading taken on day 2. Each reading contains 5 channels, where each channel contains a sequence of repetions of a single hand gesture.

- Sequence Data contains the raw sEMG data taken on day 2. Each reading conatins 5 channels, where each channel contains a random sequence of gestures.

- MATLAB Code conatins all the MATLAB code used throughout the thesis, not all needed, read explanantion in file.

- Data and feature matrices used contains the processed data from the above mentioned raw sEMG data, as well as the features extracted

- Excel conatined the excel spread sheets which conatins useful information on results
